### Cities with low mask usage but high population 

1. Milwaukee Wisconsin         population = 590,000    mask usage = 47%
2. Minneapolis, Minnesota      population = 429,000    mask usage = 60%
3. Salt Lake City, Utah        population = 200,000    mask usage = 60%
4. Cleveland, Ohio             population = 381,000    maske usage = 60%











## Ideas:

1. Taking average of the counties in each city and then compare them and look at the ones with lowest mask mandate adoption? Can also sum up for the whole state as well
2. Running regression on political party preference and mask usage within city or state
